# Machine-Learning-A-Z
Hands-On Python Data Science [link to Course !](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)

This Repo is collection of different Algorithm templates in python from the course content

Course covers entire machine learning systematic workflow and most of algorithms in the 
ML domain. Course is more of a application of the algorithms than the math behind them, though the author covers most of the "INTUTION" behind the algorithm.

Content of the Course:
* Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
* Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
* Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
* Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
* Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat
* Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
* Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
* Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
* Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA
* Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoos
